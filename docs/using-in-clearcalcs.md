## Building Calculators

### Introduction

The builder is a web-based calculator creator. All ClearCalcs calculators are added and updated regularly via the builder (for examples see [Free Engineering Tools](https://clearcalcs.com/freetools)). Each calculator is built out of individual widgets such as:

-   **Input** displays a text box accepting user input
-   **Computed** displays a label with the results of maths equations
-   **Diagram** rendering a diagram created based on this guide.

### Building

1. Drag some widgets for anything the diagram will need to accept via render params. For more details about each widget type and how they can be used, see [Builder Quick Start Guide](https://app.clickup.com/6927027/v/dc/6kcnk-1766/6kcnk-147976)
2. Drag a Diagram widget and click on the "Edit Diagram" button

</div>

3. Upload `output/index.html` (interactive diagram) and/or `dist/compiled.js` (static diagram) into the ClearCalcs builder.
4. Add values or references to other sheet widgets against each parameter
