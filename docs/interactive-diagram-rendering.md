# Interactive Diagram Rendering

## Iframe sandbox

Custom diagram should be restricted to use features available inside the `<iframe>` sandbox it is rendered in. The sandbox attribute has following allowances:

-   `allow-scripts` [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#allow-scripts) allows Javascript to be executed.
-   `allow-same-origin` allows ClearCalcs to communicate with the custom diagram via the [postMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage). The iframe origin is different from ClearCalcs.com, and this setting does not change that.

For specific browser restrictions, see [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox), which include but are not limited to:

-   no downloads
-   no form submission
-   no modals e.g. `window.alert`
-   no popups e.g. `<a target="_blank">`. User should use middle-button to open link in new tab
-   no access to parent DOM
